# Project Pitch: SignalTrace – SQL-Based ECU Diagnostics

**Project Name**: SignalTrace-SQL-Intelligence  

---
## Objective
To simulate **real-world embedded diagnostics and automotive validation scenarios** using SQL, modeled on Electronic Control Unit (ECU) logs and vehicle metadata. The project maps these practical queries to **LeetCode problems** and converts them into **domain-relevant diagnostic solutions**.

---

## Business Problem
Modern vehicles generate large volumes of signal data from ECUs. Engineers and analysts often need to:
- Detect **overheating, signal dropouts, and RPM anomalies**
- Identify **inactive or misassigned ECUs**
- Correlate faults with **geographic zones and vehicle types**
- Rank components by **failure frequency**
- Clean and normalize logs for **reporting and escalation**

This project addresses those needs by demonstrating how **SQL analytics** can be a powerful tool in **embedded validation engineering**, **support diagnostics**, and **telematics system debugging**.

---

## What Makes This Project Unique?
- Maps **diagnostic SQL queries** directly to **LeetCode problems** with real-world context.
- Includes advanced SQL logic: `CTEs`, `Window Functions`, `CASE`, `JOIN`, `RANK`, `Median`, `Rolling Average`, and more.

---

## Real-World Relevance
- Common in **infotainment validation**, **diagnostic report automation**, and **CAN signal QA**
- Useful in roles like **Embedded QA**, **Vehicle Data Analyst**, **Support Engineer**, and **Validation Engineer**
- Bridges the gap between **academic SQL practice** and **industry diagnostics**

---

## Tech Stack
- SQL (SQLite)
- Mock ECU log and metadata datasets
